  <!--Here we are making a form using the "form" command whcih makes the boiler plate code and other attributes of the form are
  also there which are used with coordination with the CSS and javascript but for now we will do only HTML so what we have is
  a simple form where there is a label, an input, various types of inputs, action, method, name and encoding type:

  > "action" does is that when we click the submit button that is the point when whatever we defined in the action
    attribute will happen here we have used "mailto" attibute of the action which forces the browser to open up a mailing App
    or just default mailing site like gmail and we have to give the email to which we have to send the mail to.

  > "method" is what the action will do with the data we have inside the form every input will be included in this.

  > "enctype" is the Encoding type which just makes sure that whatever info is submitted is in correct format.

  > "name" attribute helps the mailing app or site to differentiate between different inputs.
