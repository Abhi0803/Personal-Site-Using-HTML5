  like first we gave a thead or table head and then we have tbody or table body and at last we have a tfoot or table
  footer -->

      table cells which we will see down in the table body  -->
        <tr>

          <!--This is what we call table head cell it will also be in bold and internally what is does is that
        whenever we make a table head cell it actually makes a column and if we define 2 different table head cells
        then we will have two differnet columns here we have two table head cells Date and Description -->
